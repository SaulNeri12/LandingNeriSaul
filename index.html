        <h2>Hobbies and Things I Like</h2>

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>I like playing video games, especially single-player ones. Although I also enjoy multiplayer games to spend time and chat with my friends.</p>

        <h3>Baseball</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy playing baseball, but I don't like watching the games. I like playing as a pitcher or outfielder because I enjoy throwing.</p>

        <h3>Music and Its Production</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy music, especially the kind used in video game or movie soundtracks. I like when they create an atmosphere that perfectly matches what's on screen. I plan to buy a piano in the future to learn the basics of music, like reading sheet music, in order to compose my own tracks or songs in that style.</p>

        <h3>Science and Biology</h3>
        <p>I like everything related to science and space, but also biology—like how living beings interact with their environment, how they evolved, why they evolved, why some species go extinct, etc.</p>
