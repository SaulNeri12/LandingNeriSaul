        <h2>Hobbies & Things I Like</h2>

        <h3>Study</h3>
        <p>I am very curious, and this drives me to research various topics, especially in the field of technology, such
            as software (software architecture, software design, design patterns, messaging, etc.), or something more
            related to hardware and low-level topics like electronics and low-level programming languages.</p>

        <h3>Videogames</h3>
        <p>I like playing video games, especially single-player ones. Although I also enjoy multiplayer games to spend
            time playing and chatting with my friends.</p>

        <h3>Baseball</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy playing baseball, but I don't like watching the games. I like playing as a pitcher or an
            outfielder because I really enjoy pitching.</p>

        <h3>Music and Its Production</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy music, especially the kind used in video game or movie soundtracks. I love the combination of
            many instruments to create an atmosphere that matches what’s on screen. I plan to buy a piano in the future
            so I can learn the basics of music, like reading sheet music and everything, in order to make my own tracks
            or songs of that type of music.</p>

        <h3>Science and Biology</h3>
        <p>I like everything related to science and space, but also biology, such as how living beings relate to their
            environment, how they evolved, why they evolved, why species go extinct, etc.</p>
